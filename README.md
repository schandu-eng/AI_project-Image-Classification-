# AI_project-Image-Classification-

From a long time the term named AI has fascinated us a lot.So here's an AI project
built by me Which identifies the given handwritten(scribbled) image and Displays it.
This project is built with the help of tensorflow and Keras.TensorFlow is a very popular
machine learning tool.By leveraging TensorFlow, we can get up and running with machine
learning as fast as within 15 minutes.
So let's get started with the amazing process of Making The project
Problem Statement
1. Find a dataset online (see the "Where to Find Datasets" section below)
2. Understand and describe the modeling objective clearly2
1. What type of data is it? (images, text, audio, etc.)
2. What type of problem is it? (regression, classification, generative modeling, etc.)
3. Clean the data if required and perform exploratory analysis (plot graphs, ask questions)
4. Modeling
1. Define a model (network architecture)
2. Pick some hyperparameters
3. Train the model
4. Make predictions on samples
5. Evaluate the test dataset
6. Save the model weights
7. Record the metrics (loss, accuracy per epochs)
8. Try different hyperparameters & regularization
5. Conclusions - summarize your learning & identify opportunities for future work
6. Publish and submit your Jupyter notebook
7. Write a report to describe your experiments and summarize your work.
